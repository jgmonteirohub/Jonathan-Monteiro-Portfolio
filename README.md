# [Project #3: Estimating Median Home Values Based on Societal Variables](https://github.com/jgmonteirohub/Predicting-Median-Home-Values-With-Societal-Variables)
* Created a machine learning model that could estimate a city's median home value based on factors within the city, such as average household income, school test scores and more. 
* Utilized R programming language to webscrape information from over 1800 cities on the website "www.AreaVibes.com"
* Multiple linear regression was determined to be the most effective machine learning technique to solve this challenge 
* Analyzed 10+ predictor variables to order to ascertain which were the most important in predicting the city's median home values
